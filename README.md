Artemis Financial wanted to update its business practices. They also wanted to adopt the most recent and efficient software security as it's essential to the success of their unique software. 
There is a public online interface for Artemis Financial. They are looking for Global Rain's knowledge on how to safeguard their financial and client data.
In order to guarantee safe interactions, Artemis Financial wanted to incorporate a file verification step into their online application. A checksum will be required as a data verification step when transferring data over the web application. 
To satisfy their software security needs, you must take their present software program and implement secure communication capabilities. 
One thing that I did well is creating the certificate and importing the keystore in Eclipse to implement the checksum. This part was also very challenging since I was trying to use the Keytool feature within Eclipse.
I also did an OWASP Dependency-Check to ensure that the code compiles securely. 
I think the internet is a great resource but asking professors questions is always benificial, which helped me throughout this course.
